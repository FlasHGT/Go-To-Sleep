Simple android mobile app, which I made in Android Studio, so I could fix my sleeping schedule and limit the amount of time I spend on my phone before going to bed. There are other similar apps, but they just disable your Wi-Fi or mobile data, so I made something that would prevent the person from using their phone completely or make it very annoying.
